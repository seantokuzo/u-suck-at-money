# Agent Workflow — GSD Pattern

This project uses a **phase-based, GSD-inspired workflow**. No Jira, no sprints, no ceremonies. Phases deliver observable user capabilities.

---

## The Loop

```
1. PLAN PHASE (Agent) -> 2. EXECUTE PHASE (Agent) -> 3. VERIFY (Agent)
       ^                                                      |
6. UPDATE ROADMAP  <-  5. ADDRESS COMMENTS  <-  4. PR REVIEW
```

---

## Phase-Triggered Role Loading

| Trigger | Role to Load |
|---------|-------------|
| "Plan phase N", "What's next?" | `orchestrator.md` + `researcher.md` |
| "Build it", "Execute" | `orchestrator.md` → spawns specialists |
| "Has comments", "Address feedback" | Read pr-review.instructions.md |
| "Merged!", "Phase done" | Update PLANNING.md progress, STATE.md |

---

## Phase Execution

### 1. Research Phase

Before implementing, the orchestrator spawns `researcher.md` to:
- Investigate APIs, libraries, capabilities
- Verify assumptions from PLANNING.md
- Mark confidence: HIGH (Context7), MEDIUM (official docs), LOW (web search)
- Output prescriptive recommendations ("Use X because Y")

### 2. Plan Phase

The orchestrator decomposes work into **atomic tasks**:
- Each task = one commit
- Tasks grouped into **dependency waves**
- Wave 1 = independent tasks (run in parallel)
- Wave 2+ = tasks depending on Wave 1 outputs

### 3. Execute Phase

For each wave:
1. **Spawn specialists** — frontend, backend, etc.
2. **Each specialist gets fresh context** — paths only, not content
3. **Verify after each wave** — does it compile? does it integrate?
4. **Commit after each task** — atomic commits

### 4. Internal Review (BLOCKING)

Before ANY push:
1. Review all changed files
2. Check convention compliance (CLAUDE.md rules)
3. Fix issues, commit fixes
4. Run CI locally

### 5. PR + Copilot Review

1. Push branch
2. Create PR (not draft) with template
3. Apply labels, assign reviewer
4. Copilot auto-reviews (ensure auto-review is enabled in repo settings)
5. Run the PR review pipeline (`.agents/skills/pr-review-pipeline/SKILL.md`)

### 6. Address Comments

See `.github/instructions/pr-review.instructions.md` for the full comment-handling workflow.

## Context Management

### Thin Orchestrator

The orchestrator stays LEAN:
- Discovers work, decomposes, spawns specialists
- Never executes heavy implementation itself
- Stays under 50% context capacity
- Passes **paths** to subagents, not file contents

### Context Exhaustion Signals

- Forgetting recent decisions
- Repeating similar searches
- Response quality degrading

**When signals appear:** Finish current task, commit, tell user: _"Context is heavy — suggest fresh session."_

### Anti-Patterns

- **Analysis paralysis**: If agent reads files 5+ times without writing code → stop and report blocker
- **Context bloat**: Never paste file contents into agent prompts
- **Deep nesting**: Subagents never spawn sub-subagents

---

## Implementer Selection

Before implementing ANY task, select the right specialist:

| Domain | Specialist | Skills to Load |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Frontend / UI | `frontend-engineer.md` | Context7 (framework docs) |
| Backend / API | `backend-engineer.md` | Context7 (runtime/framework docs) |
| Research | `researcher.md` | Context7 (any library) |

<!-- Add custom specialists as your project grows -->

---

## Context7 (MANDATORY for Library Work)

**NEVER trust training data for library APIs.** Always fetch current docs:

```
1. mcp__context7__resolve-library-id -> libraryName: "react" | "fastify" | etc.
2. mcp__context7__query-docs -> id from step 1, topic, tokens: 10000
```

---

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:

1. **Code compiles** — no type errors, no build failures
2. **Tests pass** — no regressions
3. **Convention compliance** — follows CLAUDE.md rules
4. **Security** — no secrets in code, no sensitive data in logs
